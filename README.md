This project revolves around FPGA Roofline modeling and its Application to Visual SLAM. More on detail, we took a local sequence alignment algorithm and implemented it while using an FPGA board as accelerator in order to improve responsiveness and increasy efficiency in terms of resources utilized compared to a convensional x86 CPU.
